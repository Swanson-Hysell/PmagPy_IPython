These data of Ao et al., 2013 are from sites within the Nihewan Formation---Early Pleistocene fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the Nihewan Basin of North China.

The normal site means are in the Ao_etal2013_norm.txt file while the reverse site means are in the Ao_etal2013_rev.txt file.

To execute a McFadden and McElhinny (1990) reversal test on these data type the following into your terminal command line:
MM1990_revtest.py -f Ao_etal2013_norm.txt -f2 Ao_etal2013_rev.txt

Here is the reference information for the data.
