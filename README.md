PmagPy_IPython
==============

ipmag.py is a function module for paleomagnetic data analysis and plotting developed for use within IPython/Jupyter notebooks. The ipmag.py module is part of the PmagPy project (https://github.com/ltauxe/PmagPy) and relies on functions in the pmag.py and pmagplotlib.py modules. PmagPy contains many programs that can be executed at the command line. Some of the functionality availible in these programs is now availible in the the interactive IPython environment through use of ipmag.py in concert with pmag.py and pmagplotlib.py. For more on pmagpy visit https://github.com/ltauxe/PmagPy and the associated Cookbook http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook

Example IPython notebooks
==============

Within this repository there are example IPython notebooks using ipmag.py, pmag.py and pmagplotlib.py for the plotting and analysis of paleomagnetic data. These notebooks can be run by cloning the repository and running them locally using IPython. Alternatively, the notebooks can be viewed as a static html websites at these links:

Example IPython notebook for MagIC workshop
==============

Within this repository there is a simple IPython notebook with examples of IPmag.py, pmag.py and pmagplotlib.py being used in the interactive IPython notebook environment that was used as an interactive example at the end of a talk at the 2014 Magnetic Information Consortium science and database workshop (http://earthref.org/events/MAGIC/2014/). This notebook is archived with a previous version of IPmag.py, pmag.py and pmagplotlib.py. The PDF slides of that talk are also included in the repository. The notebook can be run by cloning the repository and running it locally using IPython. Alternatively, the notebook can be viewed as a static html website at this link: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Swanson-Hysell/PmagPy_IPython/blob/master/2014_MagIC_workshop/MagIC_workshop_example.ipynb
