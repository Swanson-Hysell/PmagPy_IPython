==============

Pmag function libraries for use within IPython notebooks. The IPmag.py library relies on the pmag.py library of the Pmagpy project (https://github.com/ltauxe/PmagPy) and adds new functions and modifies stand along PmagPy programs for use in the interactive IPython environment. The pmag.py library is included here very slightly modified from that availible on the main PmagPy page.
