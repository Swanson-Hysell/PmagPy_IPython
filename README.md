PmagPy_IPython
==============

IPmag.py is a function library for paleomagnetic data analysis and plotting developed for use within IPython notebooks. The IPmag.py library relies on the pmag.py and pmagplotlib.py libraries of the PmagPy project (https://github.com/ltauxe/PmagPy) and adds new functions and modifies stand alone PmagPy programs for use in the interactive IPython environment. The pmag.py library is included here as a very slightly modified version from that availible in the main PmagPy repository.
