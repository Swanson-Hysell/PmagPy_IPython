PmagPy_IPython
==============

IPmag.py is a function library for paleomagnetic data analysis and plotting developed for use within IPython notebooks. The IPmag.py library relies on the pmag.py and pmagplotlib.py libraries of the PmagPy project (https://github.com/ltauxe/PmagPy) and adds new functions and modifies stand alone PmagPy programs for use in the interactive IPython environment. The pmag.py library is included here as a very slightly modified version from that availible in the main PmagPy repository.

Example IPython notebook
==============

Within this repository there is an IPython notebook with examples of IPmag.py, pmag.py and pmagplotlib.py being used in the interactive IPython notebook environment. Note that way more is possible with the pmag.py and pmagplotlib.py libraries within the notebook environment than is currently documented in this notebook. The notebook can be run by cloning the repository and running it locally using IPython. Alternatively, the notebook can be viewed as a static html website at this link: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Swanson-Hysell/PmagPy_IPython/blob/master/IPmag_examples.ipynb

Example IPython notebook for MagIC workshop
==============

Within this repository there is a simple IPython notebook with examples of IPmag.py, pmag.py and pmagplotlib.py being used in the interactive IPython notebook environment that was used as an interactive example at the end of a talk at the 2014 Magnetic Information Consortium science and database workshop (http://earthref.org/events/MAGIC/2014/). The PDF slides of that talk are also included in the repository. The notebook can be run by cloning the repository and running it locally using IPython. Alternatively, the notebook can be viewed as a static html website at this link: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Swanson-Hysell/PmagPy_IPython/blob/master/MagIC_workshop_example.ipynb
